### Introduction
#### What is IEEE 802.11 ?

IEEE 802.11 is a set of standards for wireless local area networks (WLANs) created by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It defines the physical and data link layers of the OSI model for wireless communications. These standards specify how wireless devices, such as laptops and smartphones, can communicate with each other and with wired networks using radio waves. The most common version of IEEE 802.11 is 802.11b, which operates at 2.4GHz and can provide data rates up to 11Mbps. Other versions of IEEE 802.11 include 802.11a, which operates at 5GHz and provides data rates up to 54Mbps; 802.11g, which also operates at 2.4GHz and provides data rates up to 54Mbps; and 802.11n and 802.11ac, which both operate at both 2.4GHz and 5GHz and provide data rates of up to 600Mbps and 1.3Gbps respectively.

#### Wireless Network (WiF- Modes)

- Infrastructure mode: devices connect to an access point which acts as a hub to connect to other devices.
- Ad-hoc mode: devices connect directly to one another without the use of an access point

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Infrastructure | In this mode, wireless devices connect to an access point (AP) to communicate with other devices on the network. An AP acts as a hub that connects wireless devices to each other and to wired networks. This mode is typically used in home and office networks.|
| Ad-hoc | In this mode, wireless devices connect directly to each other without the use of an access point. This mode is typically used for short-range, peer-to-peer connections between devices such as file sharing or gaming.|
| Mesh| In this mode, multiple access points connect to each other to provide wireless coverage over a large area. This mode can be used to extend the coverage of a network or cover areas that are difficult to reach with a single access point.|
| Hotspot| In this mode, an access point is used to provide wireless internet access to guests. This mode is typically used in public places like airports, hotels, and coffee shops.|

Infrastructure mode is the most common mode for wireless networks, as it allows for easy expansion and management of a network. It also enables roaming, where a device can move around and still maintain a connection to the network. Ad-hoc mode, on the other hand, is useful in situations where a permanent network infrastructure is not available or desired, such as in temporary or small networks. However, Ad-hoc mode does not support roaming and the network range is limited to the distance between two devices.

It's worth noting that there are other wireless network modes, like Mesh mode, where multiple access points connect to each other to provide wireless coverage over a large area, or Hotspot mode, where an access point is used to provide wireless internet access to guests.

#### Wireless Network Channels (WiFi- Channels)

Wireless Network Channels (WiFi) refer to the specific frequency ranges that wireless devices use to communicate with each other. These channels are assigned specific frequencies within the radio spectrum that are set aside for wireless communications.

The channels available for use vary depending on the country and region you are in. In the United States, for example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has set aside 11 channels for use in the 2.4GHz frequency band, and an additional 20 channels in the 5GHz band.

Here's a list of the channels that are commonly used in the 2.4GHz band
|Channel	|Frequency |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1	| 2.412 GHz |
| 2	| 2.417 GHz |
| 3	| 2.422 GHz |
| 4	| 2.427 GHz |
| 5	| 2.432 GHz |
| 6	| 2.437 GHz |
| 7	| 2.442 GHz |
| 8	| 2.447 GHz |
| 9	| 2.452 GHz |
| 10	| 2.457 GHz |
| 11	| 2.462 GHz |

And here's a list of the channels that are commonly used in the 5GHz band:

|Channel	|Frequency |
|:---:|:---:|
|36	| 5.180 GHz|
|40	| 5.200 GHz|
|44	| 5.220 GHz|
|48	| 5.240 GHz|
|149	| 5.745 GHz|
|153	| 5.765 GHz|
|157	| 5.785 GHz|
|161	| 5.805 GHz|
|165	| 5.825 GHz|

The channels are shared by all devices in the same area and it can cause interference with other devices that use the same channel. It's recommended to use a channel that is not in use by other access points in your area. Some devices have the ability to scan for the least congested channel and switch to it automatically.

#### WiFi Password Packet exchange
Here is a basic diagram that illustrates the process of a wireless device connecting to a network and establishing a secure connection using a password:
```sh
Device (Client)  <----> Access Point
  |                                      |
  | (1) Request to join network          | (2) Send nonce (random number)
  |                                      |
  | (3) Send encrypted password          | (4) Verify password and establish connection
```
- The device (client) sends a request to the access point to join the network.
- The access point sends a nonce (a random number) to the device.
- The device uses the nonce and the password to encrypt the password and sends it back to the access point.
- The access point verifies the encrypted password and, if it is correct, establishes a secure connection with the device and grants it access to the network.
